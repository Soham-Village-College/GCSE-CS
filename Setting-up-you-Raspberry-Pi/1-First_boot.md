#First Boot

##Connecting your Raspberry Pi
To begin you will need to connect you pi, the sequence isn't important as long as the power is the *last* thing you connect.

1. **Carefully** insert the SD.
2. Connect the HDMI display cable (if needed)
3. Plug in your USB keyboard and mouse.
4. Connect the ethernet lead if you have one.
5. **Finally** connect the micro USB power

##Noobs Installation
On first boot you should see the **New Out Of Box** installer screen. Select **Raspbian** and click install.
The process will take about 15-20, so put your feet up!

##Raspi-config
After Noobs has completed and your Pi reboots you should see the raspi-config menu which allows you to change some system options. Use the arrow keys to select the **boot behaviour** option and choose **Desktop** option.

##YAY!
Once complete you should select **finish** and your Pi will now reboot into the pi desktop.
